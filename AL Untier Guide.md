# Your Waifu is SHIP's highly opinionated and extra-biased AL Untier Guide (NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD FOXES EDITION)

## _VERY IMPORTANT OPENING NOTE_  

"Hey, hang on a second! Where's MY waifu? I looked at the Guides and yet she's not there!"  
Well, dear reader, barring an accidental deletion on my part I am sorry to say that she didn't make it on the Tier Guides; whether it is because she failed to meet the evaluation criteria or has proven to be entirely irrelevant outside of waifu purposes, the end result is this.  
Not to despair, though! As mentioned in the Tier Guides, even untiered units can be put to use (though they won't make it easy on you), but if you'd like to have a clearer picture of who didn't make the cut and why, here's a shortlist for it.

> IJN Kiyonami has been removed from the Tier Guide, on account of being entirely obsoleted by IJN Naganami.
- Not much to say here. She's just better, as the +FP boost on a IJN DD was more of a cruel joke than an asset.

> IJN Izumo has been removed from the Tier Guide, on account of her being a total waste of time and resources.
- Quoting from her old entry in the Tier Guide:
"One really has to wonder what has Izumo ever done to developers to warrant such a treatment.
As awful in AL as she is in WoWS, Izumo is bad by any standard - her barrage barely scratches Light Armour while being unable to bypass it due to the parallel shots, her 'defensive' skill harms her much more than it does protect her due to the complete absence of enemy BB AP (and prevalence of BB HE) and worse still, as a barrage boat she needs flagship slot... while sharing Mikasa and Nagato's nation.  
Her only saving grace is the Dev35 barrage upgrade, turning it from a Bad Seven variant into an actual damage source, but the time and resources one must spend in order to acquire it - to say nothing about the higher Oil costs and comparatively poor efficiencies - make her an absolutely atrocious value proposition, especially when compared to the other AP specialists out there (Monarch, Georgia, Littorio, Alabama).
Bad not just by PR standards but as a whole, there is little to no reason to ever use her over any other barrage boat."

> USS Marblehead did not join the Tier Guide, on account of her being - basically - a reskin of the worst CL in the game, Concord.
- The tagline says it all, pretty much. Atrocious DPS, low staying power, poor and generic skill, no redeeming feature.

[01/03/2020]
> NP Pamiat Merkuria did not join the Tier Guide, on account of her being an unmitigated disaster.
- CL guns, backed by a meagre 120% Efficiency and a truly abysmal 83 FP. There are IJN DD who have more, for the reference; they won't
outgun her, but they'll also have real torpedoes to lob at enemies.
- While her bulk isn't bad and the second skill may echo Eldridge's (except it's much worse), Eldridge is stronger and more useful... and
Eldridge isn't useful to begin with, plagued as she is by low DPS already.

[27/01/2020]
> USS Halsey Powell did not join the Tier Guide, on account of her being useless.
- Doesn't have the ASW prowess of Laffey, despite the ASW buff, and definitely not the DPS.
- Doesn't have the AA to compete with any AA DD, let alone AA CLs.

> IJN Uranami did not join the Tier Guide, on account of her being useless and overcosted.
- The statline (very average IJN DD) is not good enough to warrant the purple Oil costs.
- The skills are terrible, with one being geared towards hunting DDs (something a DD with IJN-standard atrocious guns should not be
doing) and the other being a minor heal whenever an ally dies (you NEVER want any of your units to die, not even in PvP).

> HMS Amazon Kai does not join the Tier Guide, on account of her still being too weak to compensate for the exp boost.

[06/01/2020]
> Due to popular request, here is why IJN Atago is untiered.
- In short: Atago is Takao but outright worse due to skillset (Focused Fire is a lot better than Arsonist) and statline.
- Takao's Focused Fire grants +100% Main Gun damage on a 30% chance, which considering she has only one Main Gun means she enjoys a +30%
Main Gun Damage overall; Atago's Arsonist grants +15% HE damage passively, which coupled with her higher (135% vs 125%) Main Gun
Efficiency more or less results in a +30% Main Gun damage for her as well. 
The issue stems from the fact that the buff only applies to HE, and a mere +15% HE damage doesn't nearly offset the benefits of AP
versus Medium Armour (to the point where Atago should still use AP if appropriate); Takao has no such limitation and always enjoys her
+30%.
- A minor point, but Takao's higher Luck (65 vs 48) results in her being tougher than her sister.
- In either case, the Furutaka-class can easily replace both.

[30/12/2019]
> IJN Kasumi did not join the Tier Guide, on account of her being Kagerou but worse.
- Almost identical statline but costs +1 Oil due to purple rarity;
- Torpedo boost only works with a full vanguard and only affects IJN units;
- Lacks Chain Torpedo.

> IJN Hatsuharu did not join the Tier Guide, on account of her also being Kagerou but worse.
- Similar but weaker statline;
- Same skills, but lacks Kagerou's Interference and the torpedo buff only affects DDs.

[09/12/2019]
> Natsuiro Matsuri did not join the Tier Guide, on account of her middling statline and poor skillset.
- self-buff to guns is hilariosuly ineffective given the IJN DD baseline;
- self-buff and buff to damage reduction is low impact; 
- barrage is okay but not nearly enough to offset its long charge time and not guaranteed launch.

> Murasaki Shion did not join the Tier Guide, on account of her atrocious DPS and very poor skillset. 
- damage reduction is very low-impact and suffers from the same pitfalls all screenwides debuffs do;
- barrage damage is low.
